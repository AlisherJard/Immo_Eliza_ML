# 🏠🏢 Immo Machine Learning Analysis


## 📜 Description


I need to develop a machine learning model to predict real estate prices in Belgium. 
Utilizing a previously scraped, preprocessed, and analyzed dataset, our objective is to create a robust model capable
of accurate price predictions.



## 📦 Installation
 
- To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your machine.
  You also need the following Python libraries:

- `scipy`

- `matplotlib`

- `pandas`

- `seaborn`

- `numpy`

- `sklearn`

- `math`

- `warnings`


## 🛠️ Usage
  
### 1. 🧹 Feature Engineering

Making sure dataset is free of:

	•	Duplicates
	•	Blank spaces (e.g., “ I love python “ should be “I love python”)
	•	Errors
	•	Empty values


### 2. 📊 Data Formatting

Divide Dataset for Training and Testing 
Split the dataset into training and testing sets (X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test).


### 3. 🔄 📝 Model Selection and Application
Evaluate various machine learning models (Linear Regression, Multiple Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest) 
and select the one that is most suitable for my data for web deployment.


### 🖥️ Model Evaluation
Evaluate the Model 
Assess the accuracy of the model using appropriate metrics (e.g., MAE, MSE, R^2). 
Improvement Strategies
Identify ways to improve model accuracy (e.g., hyperparameter tuning, feature engineering, ensemble methods).
