# 🏠🏢 Immo Machine Learning Analysis


## 📜 Description


I need to develop a machine learning model to predict real estate prices in Belgium. 
Utilizing a previously scraped, preprocessed, and analyzed dataset, my objective is to create a robust model capable
of accurate price predictions.



## 📦 Installation
 
- To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your machine.
  You also need the following Python libraries:

- `scipy`

- `matplotlib`

- `pandas`

- `seaborn`

- `numpy`

- `sklearn`

- `math`

- `warnings`


## 🛠️ Usage
  
### 1. 🧹 Data Cleaning

Making sure dataset is free of:

	•	Duplicates
	•	Blank spaces (e.g., “ I love python “ should be “I love python”)
	•	Errors
	•	Empty values


### 2. 📊 Data Formatting

Divide Dataset for Training and Testing 
Split the dataset into training and testing sets (X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test).


### 3. 🔄 📝 Model Selection and Application

Select Appropriate Models 
Evaluate various machine learning models (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, 
Gradient Boosting) and select the one that makes the most sense for your data.
Train the selected model on the training data and apply it to the testing data.


### 🖥️ Model Evaluation
Evaluate the Model 
Assess the accuracy of the model using appropriate metrics (e.g., MAE, MSE, R^2). 
Improvement Strategies
Identify ways to improve model accuracy (e.g., hyperparameter tuning, feature engineering, ensemble methods).
